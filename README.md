# JSF

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is developed by Oracle for building user interfaces for Java-based web applications. It’s an official standard of the Java Community Process (JCP) initiative. It’s a pretty stable framework. 

This is a component-based UI framework. JSF is based on the MVC software design pattern and has an architecture that totally defines a distinction between application logic and representation.
